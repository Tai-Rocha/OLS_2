Habitat loss derived from land use change, particularly land conversion into agriculture, is still among the greatest threats to biodiversity

Mapping the Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) changes through time is, therefore, important and desirable to predict these threats and propose effective conservation policies (Jetz,Wilcove, Dobson, 2007). 

---

LULC is also an important predictor of species’ occurrence and, thus extensively used in ecological studies (Vigl, Tasser, Schirpke, Tappeiner, 2017).
