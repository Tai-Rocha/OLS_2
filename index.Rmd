Mapping the Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) changes through time is important and desirable in many fields i ecology like to predict the threats or propose effective conservation policies and others (Jetz,Wilcove, Dobson, 2007).

Despite of several initivaes provide LULC data. However most of these datasets are for short time series.

One interesting database called Land use harmonization porject, provides a set of land-use scenarios  for historical, present and future projections (years from 800 to 2300). The data raw data are continuous layers for twelve types called states

primf: forested primary land
primn: non-forested primary land
secdf: potentially forested secondary land
secdn: potentially non-forested secondary land
pastr: managed pasture
range: rangeland
urban: urban land
c3ann: C3 annual crops
c3per: C3 perennial crops
c4ann: C4 annual crops
c4per: C4 perennial crops
c3nfx: C3 nitrogen-fixing crops

However this data in provided in netcdf format, that is not user friendely for ecologist.

Main goal: 
1- Resdistribute the data in tiff format that is more commom format used in ecology analysis. 

2- Created a new data based on these all states.



How?

I build a R script to 1- extract one by one layer 
2- save each single state (which is a continuous data) as a TIF format, 
3- Perfome a analysis to create a LULC categorical data that in a new data produced here.
4- Validadtion of LULC new data (in porgress)


Results:
 1- Several continuous layers in tiff format (from 800 to 2100)
 2- Land use lan cover data categorical layr from each year
 
 
Next stpes :

1- I need to optimize the R script (prralelism?)
2- Put the prduct (layers in  Ecoclimate database, a free database.)
