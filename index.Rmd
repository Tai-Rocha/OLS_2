Mapping the Land-Use Land-Cover (LULC) changes through time is important and desirable in many fields i ecology like to predict the threats or propose effective conservation policies and others (Jetz,Wilcove, Dobson, 2007). 

---
Despite of several initivaes provide LULC data. However most of these datasets are for short time series. 
 
ESA
```{r ESA initiatives, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "40%", paged.print=TRUE, fig.align = "right"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2014/10/land_cover_2010/14949658-1-eng-GB/Land_cover_2010_pillars.jpg")
```

CGLS
```{r CGLS initiatives, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "40%", paged.print=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://land.copernicus.eu/global/sites/cgls.vito.be/files/vegetation_LC.png")

```

USGS
```{r LULC initiatives, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "40%", paged.print=TRUE, fig.align = "left"}

One interesting database called Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2), provides a set of land-use scenarios  for historical, present and future projections (years from 800 to 2300). The raw data are continuous layers for twelve types called states
```{r LUH2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "60%", paged.print=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://luh.umd.edu/images/LUH2_logo300.jpg")
```

```{r LUH2_2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width= "40%", paged.print=TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://luh.umd.edu/images/LUH2_logo300.jpg")

```

However this data in provided in netcdf format, that is not user friendely for ecologist. 

---
Main goal: 
1- Resdistribute the data in tiff format that is more commom format used in ecology analysis. 



2- Created a new data based on these all states.



---
How?

I build a R script to 1- extract one by one layer 
2- save each single state (which is a continuous data) as a TIF format, 
3- Perfome a analysis to create a LULC categorical data that in a new data produced here.
4- Validadtion of LULC new data (in porgress)

---
Results:

 2- Land use lan cover data categorical layr from each year

 Results:

 2- Land use lan cover data categorical layr from each year
 
 
 
 
Next stpes :

1- I need to optimize the R script (prralelism?)
2- Put the prduct (layers in  Ecoclimate database, a free database.)
